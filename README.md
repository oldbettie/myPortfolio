## JJ Eaton Portfolio

Hi thanks for checking out the code for my portfolio if you are interested in working with me
checkout my [upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01bb2932f2d3e396a6) or send me a
message on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayj-eaton)

This is a very simple typescript/next.js that I put together in just a few hours.
For a more detailed view of some advanced projects I have worked on we can always jump on a
call and I can run you through the source code for some of my private repositories.

Cheers.
